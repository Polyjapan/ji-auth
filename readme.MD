JI Auth
=======

It's just a slightly tweaked CAS-like protocol, really.

## Compile

You'll need to clone [https://github.com/Polyjapan/ji-auth-framework], and compile it using `sbt publishLocal`.

You can then run `sbt dist` to produce a zip, or `sbt boot` to start development environment (in which case the server will start on port 9000).

You can provide a specific configuration file using the `-Dconfig.file=path` switch.

## Client

[https://github.com/Polyjapan/ji-auth-framework] is a cool client written in scala for the JVM :)

## Protocol

The login process is quite simple: 
1. Redirect the user to a special URL
2. The user logs in
3. The user is redirected back to your app, with an `accessToken` and a `refreshToken`

Let's now dig into the details!

### 1. Registering the app

To use JI-Auth, you first need to register your app to the service. You need to be an administrator of the service in order to do that.
When registering the app, you'll need to provide a callback url. This is the URL to which the user will be redirected after logging in.

### 2. Sending the user

After registering the app, you'll get
 - a public `Client-Id`
 - a private `Client-Secret`
 
To log an user in, redirect him to `https://${API_DOMAIN}/login?app=${Client-Id}&tokenType=token`

Let's see what's in this URL:
 - `API_DOMAIN`, the server on which this API runs (usually `auth.japan-impact.ch`)
 - `tokenType=token` if you omit this parameter, it will default to `ticket`, which correspond to the deprecated old ticket protocol.
 
### 3. Checking the token

After logging in, the user will get redirected to:
`${CALLBACK URL}?access_token=${ACCESS_TOKEN}&refresh_token=${REFRESH_TOKEN}&duration=${EXP_TIME}`

The GET parameters are the following:
 - `ACCESS_TOKEN`: your main access token. It's a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) that you can paste on https://jwt.io for details. 
   It contains thw following mandatory fields:
    - `sub`: (`string`) the user ID (encoded as a string, but it's only digits so you can safely do `.toInt`)
    - `exp`: (`number`) the expiration timestamp. You **MUST NOT** accept a token if `timestampSeconds() > exp`
    - `iat`: (`number`) the issue timestamp. You **MUST NOT** accept a token if `timestampSeconds() < iat`
    - `grp`: (`string[]`) a list of groups the user is a member of
    
   Its header specifies an algorithm. **YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT A TOKEN** if its algorithm is not **ECDSA** (`ES256` currently).
   
   The token is signed using a public key. **YOU MUST VALIDATE THE TOKEN BEFORE ACCEPTING IT**.
   Beware, the JOSE standard is a bit buggy and allows users to specify `none` as the signature algorithm. YOU MUST VERIFY THE SIGNATURE ALGO AND ENSURE IT'S ECDSA.
   
   The signing key is at https://auth.japan-impact.ch/.id.pub and the certificate at https://auth.japan-impact.ch/public.cer.
   
 - `REFRESH_TOKEN`: the token you can use to redeem a new `ACCESS_TOKEN` once it's expired
 - `EXP_TIME`: the time (in seconds) during which the token is valid. Should be `exp - iat`
 
VoilÃ ! Your user is authenticated. You can use the `ACCESS_TOKEN` against any other `authentified` API that accepts it without any
additional login step. 

## API authentication

Any API that accepts these tokens proceeds them in the same way.

To access these APIs MUST pass the token in the `Authorization` header, as follows: `Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}`.

The API will reply with the following standard error codes:
 - `401` if the ACCESS_TOKEN is not valid (you may want to refresh it)
 - `403` if the ACCESS_TOKEN is valid but doesn't allow access to the resource.

As a responsible developer, we recommend that all your APIs directly accept `ACCESS_TOKEN` in the way described before.

## Common API datatypes

- `UserProfile`: the profile of an user
    - `id`: (`number`) the unique id of that user
    - `email`: (`string`) the email address of that user
    - `details`: (`UserDetails`)
    - `address`: (`optional UserAddress`)
    
- `UserDetails`: the details about an user
    - `firstName`: (`string`)
    - `lastName`: (`string`)
    - `phoneNumber`: (`optional string`)

- `UserAddress`: the address of an user. Mostly raw data, not sanitized.
    - `address`: (`string`)
    - `addressComplement`: (`optional string`)
    - `postCode`: (`string`) it's a string because of the variety of formats in the world
    - `city`: (`city`)
    - `country`: (`string`)    
    
## Public Backend APIs

The following endpoints don't require your `Client-Secret`. They can therefore be called by any client, even a single page app or android app.

### `GET /api/refresh/:refreshToken`

Get a fresh new access token.

- Parameters:
    - `refreshToken` (string): a valid refresh token
- Return type: (`json` object)
    - `accesToken`: (`string`) the new valid access token
    - `refreshToken`: (`string`) the refresh token (in the future, it may be different from the one you sent. You should always update your refresh token.)
    - `duration`: (`number`) the duration (in second) during which the `accessToken` is valid
- Errors:
    - `401`: the refresh token is not valid
    
### `GET /api/user/`

This endpoind requires an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. See the section on "API Authentication" for more details.
    
- Return type: `UserProfile`, the user profile of the token bearer
- Errors:
    - `401`: the access token is not valid or expired


## Common backend APIs

Here are some APIs that your app can use to get more infos about a user or refre

These APIs are intended to be accessed only by the backend of the apps, and not any user facing script.

The endpoints are protected and require two headers to work:

 - `X-Client-Id` for the app client id
 - `X-Client-Secret` for the app client secret
 
If the headers are missing, the endpoints return:

 - `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` with json
    - `errorCode` = `101` (Missing Data)
    
Random idea: an endpoint that takes a list of emails, and returns the ids of the accounts (allows easier migrations)

#### `GET /api/user/:userId`

Gets the profile of an arbitrary user

- Parameters:
    - `userId` (number): the id of the user you want to query
- Return type: `UserProfile`, the user profile you queried
- Errors
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the clientID is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID
        - 201: user not found

#### `GET /api/users/:userIds`

Gets the profile of up to 100 users at once.

Note that not found users are removed silently.

- Parameters:
    - `userIds` (CSV numbers): the ids of the users you want to query
- Return type: `Map[UserId (string), UserProfile]`, the found user profiles
- Errors
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the clientID is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID

#### `POST /api/groups/<group>/members`

Adds a member to a group. The app owner needs to have a write permission on that group.

Consumes:
 - `userId`: `int`, the user to add to the group
 
Returns:
 - `200 OK` if it worked
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the clientID is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID
        - 201: the group was not found (doesn't exist, or can't be accessed by this app)
        - 202: the user was not found 
        - 203: the app cannot add users to the group (app owner doesn't have write permission) 
        

#### `DELETE /api/groups/<group>/members/<userId>`

Removes <userId> from the group <group>. The app owner needs write permission on the group. If the user is an admin of the group,
the app owner needs to be admin of the group as well. This endpoint cannot remove the owner of the group.
 
Returns:
 - `200 OK` if it worked
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the clientID is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID
        - 201: the group was not found (doesn't exist, or can't be accessed by this app)
        - 202: the user was not found or not a member of the group
        - 203: the app cannot remove this user (no write permission OR trying to remove an admin without admin permission OR trying to remove owner)
        

 
#### `GET /api/ticket/<ticket>` (deprecated)

Gets the information contained on a ticket and **deletes** it.

Consumes:
 - `ticket`: `string`, the ticket sent by the server
 
Returns:
 - `200 OK` if it worked
    - `type`: `SET(T_LOGIN, T_EXPLICIT_GRANT, T_REGISTER, T_DOUBLE_REGISTER, T_EMAIL_CONFIRM, T_PASSWORD_RESET, T_APP)`
    - `userId`: `int`, the ID of the user on the CAS server
    - `email`: `string`, the email of the user.
    - `groups`: `array(string)`, the visible groups this user is part of. A group is visible if the app owner has a read permission on that group.
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the clientID is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID
        - 201: the ticket is invalid, has expired, or is not allowed to be read by this app 


#### `GET /api/app_login/<other client ID>` (deprecated)

Generates a ticket for the app to use against the app identified by the provided "other client ID".

The ticket's content will be filled from the owner of the app calling this endpoint.

This allows easy inter-apps communication, as apps only have to login like regular users.

Returns:
 - `200 OK` if it worked
    - `ticket`: `string`, a ticket of type `T_APP` to use on the app
 - `400 BAD REQUEST` if not, with additional info:
    - `errorCode`: int, in following set
        - 101: missing data in the request, or invalid request
        - 102: the other client id is not found (<=> no such app registered)        
        - 103: the clientSecret is wrong for this clientID


## Old Protocols

**This section describes old protocols that are still supported but are deprecated and will be removed in the near future.**

Because the CAS will be used on both public-facing SPA and internal standard/SP applications, we need to support two authentication modes.

An accepted drawback of this system will be that a user logging in from the "public" mode will not be able to access the "private" mode without logging in again (and vice versa). 

Note: apps are registered against the JI Auth Server with:
 - `appID`: an internal ID for the app
 - `clientID`: the public identification for the app (sent to clients) (could be the same as `appID`)
 - `clientSecret`: the private identification for the app. Kept by it, sent with some requests but **NEVER** to clients.
 - `emailCallback`: the URL where the user should be redirected when receiving the email confirmation (in public hidden mode)
 - `callback`: the URL where the user should be redirected when successfully logging in
 - `reCaptchaPkey`: the reCaptcha private key
 

### "public" Hidden Mode (implemented and deployed)

This mode is supposed to be hidden from the user. All the endpoints accept and return only JSON. They are grouped under `/hidden`.
All these endpoints are called **by the browser of the client** (so that the apps never see the credentials of the user)
but from a form hosted on the app directly (for example, a single page app).

#### Demo

User wants to register against the public SPA (and, behind the scenes, on the CAS, without knoweledge of doing so)

### "private" Explicit Mode

This mode is closer to a standard CAS protocol. When accessing a protected app for the first time, the user logs in
against the CAS. Then, the CAS creates a session for the user, as well as a ticket (as before), and redirects him to the
client app. When accessing other apps, the CAS session will be used to redirect him immediately.

#### Demo


User wants to login against the app

#### Endpoints

No real endpoint here. Send the user to `auth_server_url/login?app={app client id}`. Once registered and logged in, the
user will be redirected to `your_app_callback_url?ticket={ticket}`. You can verify the ticket using
the endpoint described before.

You can also log the user out of the CAS by redirecting him to `auth_server_url/logout?app={app client id}`. He will
then be redirected to `your_app_callback_url?logout`.

### Manager mode

We will also have to provide a small management console, to allow some authorized persons to register their own app.

## Groups

We will also add a group system.
A group has an `id`, a unique `name`, a `display_name` and an `owner_id`.

Users can be members of groups, via a (`user_id`, `group_id`) relationship.

This relationship has several boolean flags:
- `can_manage_members`: if true, this member can add and remove members from the group
- `can_read_members`: if true, this member and its apps can read the members of the group
- `is_admin`: if true, this member can change the flags of all members except the owner

The owner can change the owner, and is always member with all three flags set.

Groups will be returned in the ticket as a list: 

    groups: [group_1_name, group_2_name, ...]
    
This list will only be a subset of all the groups the user is in. This subset will **only** contain the groups for which
the `app_owner` is a member with `can_read_members` flag set on.
    
An endpoint will be added that will allow to get the information on a group

    GET /api/group/<group name>
    
    Returns:
    
    {
        id: number,
        name: string,
        display_name: string
    }
    
This endpoint requires no authentication. It is only provided to allow third party apps to display a pretty name instead
of a raw group name.
